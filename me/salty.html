      <h3>Salty Trivia with Candy Barre</h3>
      <span class="tagline">The questions are ridiculous, but the answers are serious.</span>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p class="synopsis">Participate in a virtual game show and try to win money by answering correctly. Use the Lifesaver to your advantage!</p>
  <h4>Premise</h4>
  <p>
    You’ve been selected as a remote contestant for the game show <i>Salty Trivia</i>, hosted by our sassy host Candy Barre. Answer a variety of weirdly phrased questions to win money. Each player gets a <b>Lifesaver</b>, which eliminates 2 of the options with no reduction to the point value. But it can’t be replenished or used in a special quesiton type, so use it wisely!
  </p>
  <h4>Control schemes</h4>
  <p>
    Play with phones as controllers using <a href="https://haitouch.herokuapp.com">our webpage</a>! Alternatively, share a game controller between 2 players, or huddle up on a keyboard, beacuse 4 players can play simultaneously on one keyboard, plus 1 using the mouse or touchscreen.
  </p>
  <h4>Question types</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Normal questions</b> have 4 choices, one of which is the right answer. Answer right, and you get money! Answer wrong, and you feel dumb because you lost money, but you might hear a zinger from the host as a consolation prize.</li>
    <li><b>Candy Trivia with Salty Barre</b> also have 4 choices, but the question is about candy, or sometimes based on the dumb joke on the back of a candy wrapper.</li>
    <li><b>All Outta Salt</b> gives you a nonsense phrase, whose syllables rhyme* with those of another, more popular phrase. Buzz in fast and win more money, but if you’re stumped, wait for the host to give you the three clues. <sup>*Rhymes may not be perfect in your personal accent. </sup></li>
    <li><b>Sorta Kinda</b> gives you two categories that may or may not seem related, and you have to sort the 7 items into one category or the other, or sometimes even both!</li>
    <li><b>The Thousand-Question Question</b> will start out at a whopping thousand times of a normal question’s point value! But with every bit of time that passes, that value will diminish down to zero. Only the first person to answer correctly wins the prize, so stay alert!</li>
    <li>And watch out for the final round, the <b>Sugar Rush</b> and the <b>Hike Your Likes</b>! You’ll know it when you see it!</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Notes</h4>
